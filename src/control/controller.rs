//! Controller: testable core (`Controller`) + thread shell (`spawn`).

//! Ownership (resolves the Task-13 TODO): the controller thread OWNS the
//! working actuators via `RestoreGuard`. On clean shutdown (Command::Quit or
//! command-channel disconnect) it runs `restore_all` itself and flips the
//! shared `restored` flag; main joins it. Main's stack keeps a `FinalRestore`
//! guard as the panic-path safety net (see `actuators::guard`).
//!
//! The core is pure over the `Runner` seam: `on_sample`/`on_command` mutate

//! unit-testable with `FakeRunner` and hand-fed samples. The shell only maps
